>Hi guys,

>Due to me being busy/absent from now until nearly the beginning of the course my suggestion is that we keep it simple this year and go with the same old 3 year IsA dataset (OTU table, tax assignment and environmental table as well as definition of watermasses attached). If you think this is boring and would like something “new and exciting”, then Cheshtaa has her 8 year dataset (2011-2019). I am fine with this being used on the course (and it would of course be more interesting to not know exactly what the students will find), but if so you will need to sort out the details and get the files from Cheshtaa.

>The attached 3 year data (Isa time series 2011-2014) was processed through USearch with clustering at 99%, arbitrarily removing any OTU with less than 50 reads in the total dataset and removing OTUs assigned to Streptophyta, Metazoa and Fungi. Rarefied to 5398 reads per sample. Taxonomic assignment to PR2 using blast. Only DNA from 25m is included in the files
>
>I have also included the OTU table we used last year, where nothing has been removed or rarefied (but this also includes quite a few Metazoa ++ OTUs).
